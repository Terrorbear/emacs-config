# My Emacs Configuration
Feel free to try it out and make suggestions.

The setup somewhat resembles spacemacs but doesn't heat up an oven on startup.
It contains:
1. Company for completion with some reasonable settings
2. LSP for the backend
3. Python support through el-py and jedi with docs, auto-complete, and goto-definition
4. Rust support through racer with docs, auto-complete, and goto-definiotion

It's mostly thematically similar to spacemacs. What it has over spacemacs is:
1. Ivy instead of helm. Which isn't a real selling point. Just personal preference.
2. Symbol highlighting and navigation (next and prev on the same symbol)
3. Avy quick jumps
4. Number completion in company

What it shares with spacemacs
1. That beautiful powerline
2. Window moving with shift
3. Flycheck EVERYTHING
